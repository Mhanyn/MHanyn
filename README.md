## 🛠️ Projects

Here are a few projects I've worked on:

Project 1: N-Queens Solver

Project Name: N-Queens Solver https://github.com/Mhanyn/n-queens-solver

Description: This project implements and compares two algorithms (Exhaustive Search and a Genetic Algorithm) for solving the classic N-Queens problem in computer science. It analyzes their efficiency and effectiveness across various board sizes, providing insights into the trade-offs between exhaustive search and heuristic approaches for solving combinatorial optimization problems.

Tech Stack: Tech Stack: Python, Git, Random (Python library for random number generation used in GA)

Project 2: Breast Cancer Predictor

Project Name: Breast Cancer Prediction using Logistic Regression and KNN https://github.com/Mhanyn/breast-cancer-predictor

Description:  This project develops and evaluates machine learning models (Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors) for classifying breast cancer as malignant or benign based on cell nuclei features. The project emphasizes data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, and comprehensive performance evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

Tech Stack: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn), Git
